Initial plan:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Access the URL https://erc.timetoact-group.at/assets/erc3.html and download its HTML content. This will allow offline inspection and parsing as needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: []
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "erc_competition_html",
        "variable_description": "HTML content of the ERC LLM agent competition webpage stored as text.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Parse the downloaded HTML to locate and extract the Ultimate Leaderboard section, including all presented rows and columns. This data extraction will focus on the leaderboard table and its entries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "erc_competition_html",
        "variable_description": "HTML content of the ERC LLM agent competition webpage stored as text.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "leaderboard_table_html",
        "variable_description": "HTML code representing the Ultimate Leaderboard section (just the table or relevant container).",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Extract structured data from the leaderboard HTML, obtaining the 10 first places (with highest scores). Gather for each agent: rank, name, score, and any other columns present (architecture, description, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "leaderboard_table_html",
        "variable_description": "HTML code representing the Ultimate Leaderboard section (just the table or relevant container).",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of dicts with all relevant extracted data about the top 10 LLM agents from the leaderboard. Each dict contains keys for information present in the table (e.g., rank, name, score, architecture, description, etc.).",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Analyze the extracted agent data for similarities and common characteristics among the top 10 agents. Identify trends (e.g., model sizes, architectures, provider, unique strategies mentioned, etc.). Summarize what top agents have in common and any observable technical strategies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of dicts with all relevant extracted data about the top 10 LLM agents from the leaderboard. Each dict contains keys for information present in the table (e.g., rank, name, score, architecture, description, etc.).",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "common_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "Summary of features, trends, and common characteristics among the top 10 agents, including architecture and implementation strategies.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: For each of the top 10 agents, identify and describe any unique features, outliers, or distinguishing architectural elements. Note unusual choices or innovation not broadly seen in the top group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of dicts with all relevant extracted data about the top 10 LLM agents from the leaderboard. Each dict contains keys for information present in the table (e.g., rank, name, score, architecture, description, etc.).",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "unique_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "A brief summary of unique or interesting features per top-10 agent, focusing on architectural or approach differences.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Observe additional patterns or interesting facts in the leaderboard data, such as score deltas, diversity of providers, frequency of open vs. closed source models, or anything noteworthy about the rankings, agent names, or other columns. Make note of anything significant or non-obvious.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of dicts with all relevant extracted data about the top 10 LLM agents from the leaderboard. Each dict contains keys for information present in the table (e.g., rank, name, score, architecture, description, etc.).",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "interesting_observations",
        "variable_description": "List of notable or interesting observations made during inspection of the top 10 leaderboard entries.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[str]"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7: Write a structured Markdown report (report.md in CWD), with a clear section for architectural commonalities, a section for unique agent features, and any other interesting leaderboard observations based on previous analysis. Ensure the conclusions are grounded in the extracted data and cite specific agents as needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "common_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "Summary of features, trends, and common characteristics among the top 10 agents, including architecture and implementation strategies.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    },
    {
        "variable_name": "unique_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "A brief summary of unique or interesting features per top-10 agent, focusing on architectural or approach differences.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    },
    {
        "variable_name": "interesting_observations",
        "variable_description": "List of notable or interesting observations made during inspection of the top 10 leaderboard entries.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[str]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "report_written",
        "variable_description": "Boolean indicating whether the Markdown report was successfully written to report.md in the current working directory.",
        "variable_data_type": "bool"
    }
]

Replan after step 3:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Re-parse the leaderboard_table_html to correctly extract top 10 agents by pairing each main row (team/score) with its immediately following stats row (architecture/description). For each agent, merge their data into a complete dictionary with rank, name, score, architecture, description, and other columns as needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "leaderboard_table_html",
        "variable_description": "Leaderboard table HTML containing all rows and statistics provided for each agent.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "corrected_top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of 10 dictionaries, each containing the full top-10 leaderboard entry, including proper matching of stats row data (architecture, description, etc.) with main agent data (rank, name, score, etc.).",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Analyze the corrected data for the top 10 agents to summarize common architectural strategies, design choices, model providers, and any consistent patterns among the best teams.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "corrected_top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of full entries for the top 10 best-scoring agents, each a dict with all relevant columns including architecture and description.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "common_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "Summary of observed commonalities among top agent architectures and design choices.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Identify unique features or innovations found in any of the top 10 agents—describe specific strategies, unusual setups, or noteworthy distinctions that make some agents stand out from the others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "corrected_top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of agent data dictionaries for the top 10, including all merged info.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "unique_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "A summary of unique or unusual features found in top 10 agent designs.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7: Review the leaderboard data for any additional interesting observations, such as close score ranges, cost differences, submission patterns, or notable names. Capture a list of 2-5 insights that go beyond agent architectures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "corrected_top10_agents_data",
        "variable_description": "A list of dictionaries containing fully-corrected data for the top 10 agents.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[dict[str,str]]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "interesting_observations",
        "variable_description": "A list of short observations (strings) about the leaderboard that are notable and relevant to ERC competition or agent performance.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[str]"
    }
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 8: Combine all findings into a structured Markdown report (report.md in CWD). The report should have three main sections: 1) common architectural choices among the top agents, 2) unique features and innovations per agent, 3) other interesting leaderboard observations. The report must be clearly formatted and cite agent names or ranks as needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "common_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "Summary of common architectural/design elements among the top agents.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    },
    {
        "variable_name": "unique_features_summary",
        "variable_description": "Summary of unique strategies and innovations among the top 10 agents.",
        "variable_data_type": "str"
    },
    {
        "variable_name": "interesting_observations",
        "variable_description": "List of notable observations about the leaderboard.",
        "variable_data_type": "list[str]"
    }
]
output_variables: [
    {
        "variable_name": "report_written",
        "variable_description": "Boolean flag - True if report.md was successfully written.",
        "variable_data_type": "bool"
    }
]
