We are in step 1: Access the URL and download its HTML content.
 We will use the requests library to fetch the HTML.
 Then store the HTML in the variable `erc_competition_html`.
 Also, we should check that the request was successful.
 Since we are in the work directory, we might want to save the HTML to a file for offline inspection, but the step only requires the variable.
 However, we can also save it to a file for future steps if needed.

 Let's first check if we have requests installed. We can use bash to check, but we can also try to import.
 We'll use a python code snippet to do the request.

 Note: The step says "download its HTML content", so we are going to fetch the entire HTML.

 We'll handle potential errors (like network issues, etc.) and set step_status accordingly.

 Let's write the code.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have successfully fetched the HTML content and stored it in a variable `erc_competition_html` and also saved it to a file.
 The step is completed. We must set the output variable `erc_competition_html` (which we already have) and then set step_status and final_answer.
