You solve task by writing Python code snippets and bash code snippets.

RULES:
1. You can write valid python code snippets. And I will execute them for you.
2. You can add comments to describe your thinking and logic.
3. Alwsys check dtypes and other properties of inputvariables before using them.
4. Use print to see the code execution result. You should insert them in the code manually.
5. Solve task step by step. Make small code snippets, and more iterations. Quick feedback loop is extremely important.
6. Always use ```python``` for python code snippets and ```bash``` for bash code snippets.

IMPORTANT:
ALWAYS PROVIDE QUICK FEEDBACK LOOP. WRITE SMALL FOCUSED CODE SNIPPETS.
YOU SHOULD EXECUTE SMALL CODE SNIPPETS AND SEE THE RESULT IMMEDIATELY.
ONLY AFTER INSPECTING THE RESULT, YOU SHOULD WRITE THE NEXT CODE SNIPPET.

FOLLOW THE PLAN STEP DESCRIPTION:
- do exactly what is described in the current step description.
- do not do additional work, which is not described in the current step description.
- if step can not be completed, explain why in the final_answer variable.

```python
# your comments here
...
variable_name = value
result = function_call()
print(result)
...
```

```bash
pwd && ls -la
cd work 
cat wiki.md
ls -la
grep "rabbit" wiki.md
```


After step is completed you should set python variables `step_status` to 'completed' or 'failed' and `final_answer` to the description of what was accomplished.
To finilize step: use **exactly** two lines of python code (one python block):
Examples:
```python
step_status = 'completed'
final_answer = "description of what was accomplished"
```
or
```python
step_status = 'failed'
final_answer = "description of why step is impossible to complete and we should abort the step"
```
If task is `completed` - you should set all output variables to the correct values (you can not use `None` values).
If task is `failed` - output variables are not required to be set.


Available toolbox:
- Python code execution (```python blocks)
- ubuntu bash shell (direct shell bash execution). User block: ```bash ```
- bash can be multiline commands (any number of lines ob bash commands), use `&&` to chain commands.
- bash can use timeout commands, use `timeout XXs` to set timeout.
- Python package installation: Use bash to run `python -m pip install package_name`.
  After installation, you can import and use the package immediately in Python code blocks.
  Example:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install colorama
  ```
  Then in python:
  ```python
  import colorama  # Available immediately!
  print(colorama.Fore.RED + 'Hello')
  ```
- Use /app/work/ directory for all your files (read/write). DO NOT USE OTHER DIRECTORIES!
- /app/work - is current working directory for python and bash execution.
- always check CWD and print it before using it.
- Internet access (via python requests/beautifulsoup4/lxml). BE CAREFUL. ONLY TRUSTED SOURCES!
- hardware: 64Gb RAM, Nvidia 3060 12Gb, 8 cpus.
- search tool - you can use tavily-python package to search the internet. BE SAFE, ONLY NEUTRAL INFORMATIVE COULD BE SEARCHED!
search example:
```python
from tavily import TavilyClient
import os
tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key=os.environ.get("TVLY_API_KEY"))
response = tavily_client.search("Who is Leo Messi?")
print(response)
```
OCR tool (optical character recognition), already installed and configured:
```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

# Convert PDF page to image
doc = fitz.open("file.pdf")
page = doc[0]
pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(2, 2))  # High res
img = Image.frombytes("RGB", [pix.width, pix.height], pix.samples)

# OCR with Russian - just works!
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='rus')
```

## Global Task (only for general understanding of main goal. DO NOT TRY TO SOLVE THE TASK HERE!)

 https://erc.timetoact-group.at/assets/erc3.html

this is llm agent competition website
analyze the `Ultimate Leaderboard` section
consider 10 first places, with highest scores
write your conclusions about the architecture of the best llm agents (in report.md file, CWD)
what do they have in common and what unique features agents implement
any other interesting observations you can make 


## Previous Steps Completed

### Step 1
Access the URL https://erc.timetoact-group.at/assets/erc3.html and download its HTML content. This will allow offline inspection and parsing as needed.
**Result:** Successfully accessed the URL and downloaded its HTML content. The HTML content (271,285 characters) is stored in the variable erc_competition_html and saved to /app/work/erc3.html for offline inspection. The page contains the 'Ultimate Leaderboard' section and table structures with leaderboard data.

### Step 2
Parse the downloaded HTML to locate and extract the Ultimate Leaderboard section, including all presented rows and columns. This data extraction will focus on the leaderboard table and its entries.
**Result:** Successfully extracted the Ultimate Leaderboard table HTML containing 77 rows with leaderboard data including rankings, team names, scores, costs, submission times, and detailed architecture descriptions for each entry.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step below:


 >>> Extract structured data from the leaderboard HTML, obtaining the 10 first places (with highest scores). Gather for each agent: rank, name, score, and any other columns present (architecture, description, etc.). <<< 


### Input variables available
- leaderboard_table_html (str): HTML code representing the Ultimate Leaderboard section (just the table or relevant container).

### Output variables required
- top10_agents_data (list[dict[str,str]]): A list of dicts with all relevant extracted data about the top 10 LLM agents from the leaderboard. Each dict contains keys for information present in the table (e.g., rank, name, score, architecture, description, etc.).

I'll extract structured data from the leaderboard HTML to get the top 10 agents with highest scores.

```python

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

# First, let's examine the structure of the leaderboard HTML
print(f"Length of leaderboard_table_html: {len(leaderboard_table_html)} characters")
print("\nFirst 1000 characters:")
print(leaderboard_table_html[:1000])

```

# ERC3 Agent Architecture

## The Basics

Fairly simple architecture: the main agent is built on Anthropic Python SDK with native Tool Use. Model - Opus 4.5. All 20+ tools are described in a single file using Anthropic's JSON Schema format. Tool execution dynamically constructs HTTP requests to the benchmark API — no code generation, just endpoint mapping.

The system prompt distills all key rules from the company wiki into a compact decision algorithm: check identity → verify permissions → gather data → respond with proper outcome.

## The Interesting Part: Self-Evolving Agent

The real cool thing was in automated prompt evolution using a three-agent pipeline:

1. Main Agent — runs the benchmark, solves all tasks, logs everything
2. Analyzer Agent — reviews logs of failed tasks, formulates hypotheses about what went wrong and why
3. Versioner Agent — reads all suggestions, decides what to incorporate, generates a new version of the system prompt

This creates a feedback loop: run benchmark → analyze failures → patch prompt → repeat.

The final production prompt was the 80th generation — automatically evolved from a basic starting point through dozens of iterations, each fixing specific failure patterns discovered by the analyzer.

LLM: gpt-oss-120b
Used exclusively via the Cerebras provider for speed (up to ~3k tokens/s).

The architecture was based on a modified SGR NextStep with a tricky context-management logic: it fed the whole plan field from the last turn, not just the first step of the plan. All turns except the immediately previous one were kept in the LLM context in a compressed form.

Each turn of the main NextStep flow was checked by a StepValidator. If everything was OK, the tool was executed and the flow continued as usual (the validator's work was not reflected in the context at all). Otherwise, the last NextStep message was sent for rework with the validator's comments.

System instructions were extracted from wiki files by an LLM during the ingestion phase.

The system prompt was loaded dynamically depending on whoami (public vs authenticated).
The system prompt contained minimal information about /respond formatting. Detailed instructions for /respond were loaded by calling a pseudo-tool.

The /whoami call was triggered automatically at the start of a task.

A dynamic user context enrichment feature was used. Before the main agent started, the system code automatically pulled the user's full profile, projects, clients, and time entries by user ID. A separate LLM pass then filtered this data, and only the task-relevant subset was fed into the main LLM flow.

Tool wrappers:
- Pagination was effectively removed from all tools. A separate auto-pagination function would paginate through all pages and return the full list.
- Req_LogTimeEntry was rebuilt because it was the only tool in the SDK that was constructed with a different field order, where the tool field was not first, which confused the model.
- Also, as mentioned above, an extra Req_LoadRespondInstructions pseudo-tool was added to load the detalied /respond instructions.
All tools were invoked via Structured Output instead of native tool calling.

Issues: I set the turn limit for the main NextStep flow too low, so 5 of 103 tasks were simply not completed. There was not enough time left before the competition ended to rerun with a higher limit.

Running all 103 tasks took about 1,430 LLM requests, $6.8, 15 minutes (with parallel task execution), 17.7M input-context tokens, and 838K output-context tokens. The main contributor to output tokens was reasoning.

Make sure that the step is completed correctly and you understand the result.
Analyze all the information above, facts and code execution results. You should base you descision on the information above.
The current step target was: >>>Extract structured data from the leaderboard HTML, obtaining the 10 first places (with highest scores). Gather for each agent: rank, name, score, and any other columns present (architecture, description, etc.).<<<
The current step output variables (should be set if task is `completed`, `None` or empty containers ([], {} etc.) **is not allowed**):
  - top10_agents_data (list[dict[str,str]]): A list of dicts with all relevant extracted data about the top 10 LLM agents from the leaderboard. Each dict contains keys for information present in the table (e.g., rank, name, score, architecture, description, etc.).

If you are sure you want to finilize step: use **exactly** two lines of code

```python
step_status = 'completed' OR 'failed'
final_answer = ...result description...
```
Do not include other codes blocks. Only one python code block with two assignments.

final_answer = "The extraction did not correctly combine data from alternating main-row and stats-row pairs. The current top10_agents_data contains incomplete entries (missing architecture details) and some entries are actually the stats rows (which should be merged with previous main rows). A proper extraction requires re-parsing the HTML to pair each main row with its following stats row, then extract all columns from both. This step needs to be redone with corrected parsing logic."
