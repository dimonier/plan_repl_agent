We are given the HTML content as a string. We need to extract the Ultimate Leaderboard section, specifically the table and its rows and columns.
 Let's first examine the structure of the HTML to find the leaderboard table.
 We'll use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and locate the table.

 Steps:
 1. Parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup.
 2. Look for the section that contains the Ultimate Leaderboard. We can search by the text "Ultimate Leaderboard" or by the structure.
 3. Once we find the section, we can then extract the table. We'll look for a <table> element within that section.

 However, note that the requirement is to extract the table HTML code as a string. We can get the outer HTML of the table.

 Let's write a code snippet to do that. We'll also print a snippet of the table to confirm.

 We'll also check if there are multiple tables and ensure we get the correct one.

 We'll use BeautifulSoup to find the table. We can look for the table with class or id if available.

 Let's first inspect the HTML by looking at a few lines to understand the structure.

 But note: the entire HTML is stored in the variable erc_competition_html. We'll use that.

 Let's start by importing BeautifulSoup and parsing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have successfully extracted the leaderboard table. The variable `leaderboard_table_html` has been set to a string containing the HTML of the table (length 46031). We have verified that the table contains the expected columns and rows (77 rows, including the header and alternating rows of data and descriptions). Therefore, the step is completed.

We set the output variable `leaderboard_table_html` to the extracted HTML string and mark the step as completed.
