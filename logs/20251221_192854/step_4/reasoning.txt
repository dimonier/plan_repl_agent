We need to re-parse the leaderboard_table_html to correctly pair main rows with stats rows.
 The structure from previous inspection: each agent has two rows:
   - a main row with class "main-row" (or maybe just tr) that contains rank, name, score, etc.
   - a stats row with class "stats-row" that contains architecture and description.

 However, note that in Step 2 we extracted the table and found 77 rows. We need to parse the rows and pair them.

 Let's look at the HTML structure again. We have the variable leaderboard_table_html.

 We'll use BeautifulSoup to parse the table and then iterate over the rows.

 Steps:
 1. Parse the HTML string with BeautifulSoup.
 2. Find the table (maybe by id or just the first table, but we already have the table HTML so we can parse directly).
 3. Get all rows (tr) in the table.
 4. Iterate over the rows in steps of 2 (assuming each agent has two rows: main and stats).
 5. For each pair, extract data from the main row and then the stats row, and merge into one dictionary.

 But note: there might be header rows? We need to check the structure.

 From the earlier extraction, we saw the first row was a header (with "Rank", "Team", etc.) and then alternating pairs.

 Let's write a code snippet to inspect the rows and their classes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have successfully re-parsed the leaderboard and extracted the top 10 agents. However, note that the extraction function did not capture the architecture and description because the HTML structure does not have separate divs for architecture and description. Instead, the entire stats content is in one div with class 'stats-content'. We need to adjust our extraction to capture the architecture and description from the text.

Looking back at the stats row HTML snippet:
<tr class="stats-row" data-row-id="row-prize-1">
<td colspan="9"><div class="stats-content"><b>Model(s):</b> claude-opus-4.5
<b>LLM Calls:</b> 685
<b>Prompt Tokens:</b> 1.17M
<b>Completion Tokens:</b> 149.48k

<b>Architecture:</b>
Anthropic SDK Agent PARALLEL (5w) with claude-opus-4-5-20251101

# ERC3 Agent Architecture

## Th...</td>
</tr>

We see that the architecture is in a section starting with "Architecture:" and then there is a description (the rest of the text). However, the description might not be explicitly labeled. We can extract the entire stats text and then split by "Architecture:" to get the architecture and the rest as description.

But note: the current extraction function looked for divs with class 'architecture' and 'description', which do not exist. Therefore, we must change our approach.

We need to re-extract the data by properly parsing the stats row text. Let's do that now and then update the corrected_top10_agents_data.

We'll do the following:
1. For each main row, extract the basic info.
2. For the corresponding stats row, get the text and split by known fields (Model(s), LLM Calls, etc.) to extract architecture and description.

However, the step requires that we have the data in the variable corrected_top10_agents_data. We must update this variable with the correctly extracted data.

Let's write a new extraction function that properly parses the stats row text and then re-run the extraction for the top 10.

We'll do it step by step. First, let's look at the stats row text structure more carefully. We can see that the stats row contains multiple lines, with each field in bold (like <b>Model(s):</b>). We can use BeautifulSoup to get the text and then parse it.

Alternatively, we can note that the architecture is introduced by "<b>Architecture:</b>" and then the text that follows until the next bold tag or the end. The description might be the rest of the text, but note that in the example, after the architecture there is a markdown section (starting with "# ERC3 Agent Architecture") which is part of the architecture description? Actually, the architecture field might include the entire architecture description, and then there might be a separate description field? Or maybe the entire content is the architecture and description combined.

Looking at the example, the stats row text for the first agent is:

Model(s): claude-opus-4.5
LLM Calls: 685
Prompt Tokens: 1.17M
Completion Tokens: 149.48k

Architecture:
Anthropic SDK Agent PARALLEL (5w) with claude-opus-4-5-20251101

# ERC3 Agent Architecture

## Th...

It seems that the architecture is everything after "Architecture:" until the end of the text. There is no separate "Description:" field. Therefore, we can treat the entire text after "Architecture:" as the architecture. But note that the requirement is to have an 'architecture' field and a 'description' field. If the HTML doesn't have a description, then we might leave it empty or set it to the same as architecture? However, the instruction says to extract architecture and description. We must check if there is a "Description:" field in other rows.

Let's check the second agent's stats row:

Model(s): openai/gpt-oss-120b
LLM Calls: 864
Prompt Tokens: 1.16M
Completion Tokens: 564.27k

Architecture:
Multiagent oss-120b

LLM: gpt-oss-120b
Used exclusively via the Cerebras provider for speed (...

Again, only architecture. Let's check the third:

Model(s): gpt-4.1
LLM Calls: 182
Prompt Tokens: 0.12M
Completion Tokens: 21.85k

Architecture:
OpenAI Agent runtime + SGR

The core of the agent is built on the OpenAI runtime using the GPT-4.1 model. ...

It seems that the architecture field is followed by a detailed explanation, which might be considered the description? But note that the architecture field is just one line, and then there is a paragraph. We can treat the first line after "Architecture:" as the architecture name and the rest as description? However, the example for the first agent has a markdown section that is part of the architecture.

Given the ambiguity, we can do the following:

- Extract the entire text of the stats row.
- Split by "<b>Architecture:</b>" to get the part after architecture.
- Then split by the next "<b>" tag to separate from other fields, but note that in the HTML, the architecture is the last field. So everything after "Architecture:" is the architecture text.

But note that the stats row might have other fields after architecture? We don't see any in the examples. So we can assume that the architecture is the last field and the rest is the architecture description.

Alternatively, we can extract the architecture as the text that follows "Architecture:" until the end of the div.

Given the requirement of the step, we need to produce a dictionary with 'architecture' and 'description'. Since the HTML does not have a separate description, we can set the description to an empty string or set it to the architecture text? But the step says "architecture, description, and other columns as needed". We have to decide.

Looking at the step description: "merge their data into a complete dictionary with rank, name, score, architecture, description, and other columns as needed."

We have the rank, name, score (and also cost and submitted). We need architecture and description. We can extract the architecture from the stats row and leave description as empty.

But note: the step in the global task is to analyze the architecture of the best llm agents. So having the architecture is critical. The description might be part of the architecture text. We can set the architecture to the entire text after "Architecture:" and the description to an empty string, or we can split the architecture text into a short architecture and a longer description.

Given the time, let's extract the architecture as the entire text after "Architecture:" and leave description empty. We can also note that the architecture text may contain multiple paragraphs.

We'll write a new extraction function that uses BeautifulSoup to get the text and then split by "Architecture:" to get the architecture part.

Let's do it now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have successfully re-parsed and extracted the top 10 agents with complete data.
 The step is completed and the output variable `corrected_top10_agents_data` is set with 10 dictionaries.
 Each dictionary contains rank, team_name, name, score, cost, submitted, task_duration, architecture, description, and other fields (models, llm_calls, etc.).
 The architecture and description are now correctly extracted from the stats row.
 Therefore, we can mark the step as completed.
