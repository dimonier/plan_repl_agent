We have the three summaries from previous steps. We need to combine them into a structured Markdown report.
 The report should be saved as `report.md` in the current working directory.
 We'll create the file with three main sections:
   1. Common Architectural Choices
   2. Unique Features and Innovations
   3. Other Interesting Leaderboard Observations

 We'll use the provided variables: common_features_summary, unique_features_summary, interesting_observations.

 Let's first check the current working directory and then write the file.

 Since we are at Step 7, we have the input variables. We can write the report.

 Let's write the report with proper formatting.

 We'll set report_written to True after writing the file.

 We should also check that the file exists and has content.

 Let's do it step by step.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have successfully created the report.md file with all required sections.
 The output variable `report_written` is set to True.
 Let's finalize the step.
