We've got this question about the room assignment. We, as a company, we're going to the trip, not the business trip, like a rest in the countryside house. And we need to assign pairs of persons. We have approximately 1,000 people, and each one states with whom he wants to stay. And each... we have only men in our company, just men. So anybody can pair up, and it's okay. But each person stated with whom he wants to stay. It could be 0 or M candidates, options. So we have a big table with the desire, with the... what people want. For example, the person A wants to be with F, D and G, something like this. But with 1,000 persons. So we need to optimize it somehow. Propose how we can optimize and pair persons appropriately. If some information or inputs are missing, just think of the common sense options. But you need to propose some kind of approach algorithm to assign. And each... it's very important. There is an infinite number of homes, and each home can contain exactly two persons. So 1,000, for example, it's... even a number of persons. We basically need to pair them up like 5,000 homes. But how can we do it optimally? Taking into account the information they expressed, and their desire, and their position, their desired adoption.
