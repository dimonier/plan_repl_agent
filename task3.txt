We have file: `employee_skills.md` (see CWD, ./employee/employee_skills.md)
We need to segment all employees into three groups:
- technical specialists
- managers and project leads
- executives and board members
If direct information is not available, try to infer this from the context or from indirect logic.
Use some heuristics to segment employees.

You should work only in ./employee folder.
